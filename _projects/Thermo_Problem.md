    In Thermodynamics class, I was tasked with exploring a specific, real-world device that implements the principles we had learned in class. I chose the turbine used by Cornell's hydroelectric power plant that utilizes the motion of water from Beebe Lake to Fall Creek to generate electricity, resulting in 3 to 5 percent of the University's consumption each year.

## Overview

The plant uses two Ossberger cross-flow turbines. We chose to analyze the second unit listed on the Cornell Facilities page, named the **Crossflow G1078/20g (2 cell)**.

In these types of systems, water typically flows in from a body of water and passes through inlet guides. These regulate flow rate and direct the water across the turbine’s blades twice, hence the **cross-flow** name, maximizing the amount of energy that can be harnessed. Water finally exits on the opposite side and continues through the waterway.

A benefit of cross-flow turbines is that they operate adequately at a variety of flow rates, and their efficiency remains relatively constant over a wide range of inputs. This is ideal for small river applications like this one, where flow is far from constant under the variable weather conditions of Ithaca.
